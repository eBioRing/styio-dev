# 1. Pay the price for efficiency.

Efficiency can be significantly improved by providing high-level knowledge, which is usually given by programmers. Styio will dynamically deduce types and eplicitly do something (etc. type conversion). If you want the program to be very fast, you need to include all details in the source code.&#x20;

If you don't want implicit behaviours, then turn on the strict mode and everything is subsequently required to be declared explicitly. You may choose to turn on only several options to get a semi-strict compiler that can do some (not all) deduction for you. The strict mode for those who is insane in getting high efficiency and the options are for those who want to create a customized programming language from Styio.
