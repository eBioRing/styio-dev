1. I decided to build a token-based parser to substitute the string based parser.
2. Add a method (check\_seq\_of) to StyioContext to recognize if a token occurs repeatly.
3. Add StyioTokenMap to map derived tokens to fundamental tokens.

1. I realized that styio needs a way to express a **backward filling operation**. The code below illustrates a way to extract certain intermediate values from a sequence of data operations.

```
(a, b) << @("some") => {
    onething -> a
    another -> b
}
```

2. I realized that the previous syntax of verbatim string conflicts with the syntax of resources and may lead to ambiguity. Therefore, I removed verbatim string and hope there will be a better way to fix this problem.

```
@"verbatim.string"
@("file")
```

For now, I think backtick `` ` `` might a good idea.

```
`\this \is \a \vertatim \string \n`
```

3. **Resource identifiers** `@("")` **are designed to represent files and network addresses, and they must be accessible.**
4. I added a map for binary operations to eliminate switch cases in C++ code.
5. I added a command line option `--debug` , which controls whether to display debug information.
6. I decided to write weekly reports to record what has been changed this week.&#x20;
